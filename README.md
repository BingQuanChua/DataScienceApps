# Some Data Science Apps

Learning how to build data science apps from freeCodeCamp.org

Following this tutorial: [Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&list=PLRpb1EfB9cjuOFw_ZVmeqlCgdhYjdbBMO&index=10&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) (actually there are only 10)

The tutorial above covers how to build interactive and data-driven Python web apps using the Streamlit library. This repo contains 9 web apps built from the tutorial with slight modifications.

To install the Streamlit library

```
pip install streamlit
```

To run a web app

```
streamlit run myapp.py
```
