# Data Science Web Apps

Learning how to build data science apps from freeCodeCamp.org

Tutorial by Data Professor: [Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&list=PLRpb1EfB9cjuOFw_ZVmeqlCgdhYjdbBMO&index=10&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) (actually there are only 10)

The tutorial above covers how to build interactive and data-driven Python web apps using the Streamlit library. This repo contains 9 web apps built from the tutorial with slight modifications and enhancement.

To install the Streamlit library

```
pip install streamlit
```

To run a web app

```
streamlit run myapp.py
```

## :four: S&P 500 Stock Price App 

The [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) (the Standard and Poor's 500) is a market-‚Äãcapitalization-weighted measurement stock market index of the 500 largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices by investors.

A web app that scraps all latest data from the [list of S&P 500 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) on Wikipedia, fetch their respective stock price data and plot the stock closing price. 

* Web scraping with `pandas`
* Fetching stock price with `yfinance`
* Filtering data with conditions in `pandas` (data wrangling)
* Slider in `streamlit`

## :six: Simple Iris Flower Prediction App

A web app that predicts the iris flower type from the user input. The prediction is made by using a Random Forest Classification. Accepts user input parameters (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and predict using a model built from the dataset.

The model applies the [Iris Plants Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-plants-dataset) provided in the scikit-learn library.

* Built a classifier using the RandomForestClassifier model from `sklearn`

## :seven: Simple Palmer Penguin Prediction App

Predicts the palmer penguin species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Ad√©lie penguins) by using a classification model. Accepts user input in the form of CSV file upload or direct input.

The original [Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) is provided by Allison Horst. The model in this web app uses the [cleaned dataset](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data/blob/master/penguins_cleaned.csv) provided by Data Professor.

* Built a classifier using the RandomForestClassifier model from `sklearn`
* File uploader in `streamlit`

## :eight: Boston Housing Price Prediction App

Predicts the median value of Boston House Price from the given input parameters which consists of:

* **crim**: per capita crime rate by town.
* **zn**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* **indus**: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* **chas**: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
* **nox**: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
* **rm**: average number of rooms per dwelling.
* **age**: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
* **dis**: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
* **rad**: index of accessibility to radial highways.
* **tax**: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.
* **ptratio**: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* **b**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
* **lstat**: lower status of the population (percent).

The regression model uses Random Forest Regressor, trained by the [Boston House Prices Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#boston-house-prices-dataset) provided in the scikit-learn library. The model's prediction is explained by [SHAP values](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).

* Built a regressor using the RandomForestRegressor model from `sklearn`
* Using `shap` to explain the outcome of the prediction

## :nine: Molecular Solubility Prediction App

Predict the solubility value (LogS) of input molecules. The input molecules must be in the [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) notation. With the help of the RDKit library, this app will compute four descriptors for each molecule:

* MolLogP
* Molecular Weight
* Number Of Rotatable Bonds
* Aromatic Proportion

These four variables are crucial to the Linear Regression model as suggested by John S. Delaney in [ESOL:‚Äâ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci034243x). A [cleaned dataset](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data/blob/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv) for training the model is provided by Data Professor.

The installation of the RDKit library using pip can be impossible for now, hence it is suggested to [Install RDKit with Conda](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html). This includes creating a conda environment for the installation.

* Built a regressor using the LinearRegression model from `sklearn`
* Using `rdkit` for computing the required variables for the prediction
